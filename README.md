# 🍷 DBSCAN Wine Clustering Engine

A sophisticated unsupervised learning project leveraging Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). This implementation focuses on identifying non-linear groupings within wine characteristics, effectively separating signal from noise.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🔹 **Density-Based Analysis**: Identifies core points and outliers (noise) in high-dimensional feature spaces.
- 🔹 **Non-Linear Discovery**: Successfully clusters wine profiles that standard algorithms like K-Means might miss.
- 🔹 **Automated Eps Discovery**: Implementation of Nearest Neighbors analysis to determine optimal epsilon values.
- 🔹 **Multidimensional Visualization**: Interactive charts for exploring chemical profiles across different wine varieties.

## 🧪 Technical Stack
- **Modeling**: DBSCAN (Scikit-Learn)
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Matplotlib
- **Preprocessing**: StandardScaler, PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Integration
